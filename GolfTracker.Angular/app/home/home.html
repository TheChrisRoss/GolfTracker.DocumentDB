<h1>Welcome to Golf Tracker (Azure DocumentDB)</h1>
<p>
    This is an AngularJS client that interacts with an ASP.NET WebApi 2 service that 
    uses Windows Azure DocumentDB as the data store.  It's a reference application 
    that shows some more "real-world" implementations of using DocumentDB with clients
    in a flexible way.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a list of some of the technologies used in this application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows Azure DocumentDB</li>
            <li>ASP.NET WebApi 2</li>
            <li>Angular JS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I built this application as a proof-of-concept to test whether I could use DocumentDB in a certain fashion 
        that is needed for an upcoming project.
        </p>
        <h3>Single Collection Concept</h3>
        <p>
            Since DocumentDB is a new NoSql offering from Azure, and since I'm new to NoSql I wanted to "test the waters",
            with some concepts I needed to use with DocumentDB.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>single-collection concept</b> (which I'm coining), means that due to certain pricing policies, I need to initially
            store all of my data in a single collection.  So I needed an easy-to-replicate way of handling this when I wanted
            to create a new "schema".  This application demonstrates this.

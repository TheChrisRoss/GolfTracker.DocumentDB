# GolfTracker.DocumentDB
A sample application that uses AngularJS for the front-end client and Windows Azure DocumentDB in a WebApi 2 service as the RESTful backend.
I will be creating an article and possibly some videos describing how it works and why I chose to design the infrastructure this way.

# New GolfTracker - Angular 2 - 7/1/2016
This application is a port of the Angular 1/Azure DocumentDB application.  It is written using Angular 2 (RC 4) and currently can point to Azure DocumentDB or MongoDB endpoints.  Just add the Urls to these data stores.

This application focuses more on the implementation of Angular 2 than the NoSql data store.  It provides a good reference application to jump-start your Angular 2 project.

As of 7/22/2016 everything works, except there is not authentication/authorization provider written.  That is currently in the works.  Check back for updates.

I hope this helps.
